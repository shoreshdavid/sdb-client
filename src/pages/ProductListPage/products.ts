      Is belief in the resurrection of Yeshua (the Hebrew name of
      Jesus) a matter of faith, or is there historical evidence to
      support its occurrence? Even if there is compelling evidence,
      one question remains—how did this seemingly impossible event
      take place? We struggle to wrap our minds around this, and
      justifiably so. We are faced with a daunting paradox: can a
      historic event be validated despite its miraculous nature?
    </p>
    <p>
      Attorney and former atheist Jim Jacob sought well-grounded
      answers to these questions and many others. He has researched
      and compiled evidence to answer such important questions as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Are the gospels in the New Covenant historically accurate?
      </li>
      <li>Did Yeshua actually live?</li>
      <li>Was He crucified by the Romans?</li>
      <li>Did Yeshua truly rise from the dead?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As he has done throughout his nearly 40-year legal career, Jacob
      presents clear evidence that answers these questions and
      confronts head-on the rebuttal arguments as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an individual is requested to serve on a jury, he or she is
      asked to set aside any biases and serve impartially as a juror,
      giving both sides a fair trial. If you desire to objectively
      assess the evidence and determine whether there is any validity
      to the claims of the followers of Yeshua, then this booklet is
      for you.

      This powerful book reveals the latest scientific, mathematical,
      historical, and prophetic proofs, about what is HAPPENING TODAY
      in America and Israel and making today’s headlines! Yet the
      prophecies were written over 2,000 years ago!
    </p>

    <p>
      Rabbi Don Goldstein, has compiled the newest findings from the
      world’s top scholars and presents them in this easy to read and
      humorous book. It is stunning and to the point!
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you know the ancient Hebrew Bible tells us that Israel would
      become an independent country again in exactly 1948? And that
      Jerusalem would come back into Jewish hands in exactly 1967?
    </p>
    <p>What was found in the “secret” Dead Sea Scrolls?</p>
    <p>Evolution, is it fact or fantasy?</p>
    <p>What about Nostradamus – Are his prophecies real?</p>
    <p>
      How can the earth only be 6000 years old when the scientists say
      it is billions? See what quantum physics has recently
      discovered.
    </p>
    <p>Why am I here?</p>
    <p>What is my purpose and destiny?</p>
    <p>
      How can I really KNOW that God is real, He is alive, and He is
      involved in my life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Yeshua (Jesus) was Jewish, why don’t more of today’s
      rabbis believe He is the Messiah? What REALLY happens when we
      die?
    </p>
    <p>Why does a “good” God allow so much suffering?</p>
    <p>
      Why did 6 million Jews and 6 million gentiles have to die in the
      holocaust?
    </p>
    <p>And much, much more…</p>

      Jesus was a Jew. The writers of Scripture were Jews. The early
      church emerged in a Jewish environment. So why the tension
      between Jews and Christians, and why have so few Jews come to
      believe in the Messiah?
    </p>
    <p>
      In The Fig Tree Blossoms, Paul Liberman uncovers the Jewish
      roots of the Christian faith and helps Gentile believers come to
      a deeper understanding of the historic issues that have fed
      Jewish suspicion of Christians and Christian prejudice toward
      Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in these last days, Liberman writes, God is using the
      emerging Messianic movement to bring many Jews into His kingdom
      and to awaken Gentile Christians to their Jewish faith heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of casting blame or assigning guilt, Liberman calls
      Gentile Christians to embrace their Messianic brothers’ and
      sisters’ Jewish expressions of faith in much the same way the
      Apostle Paul encouraged his fellow Jews to embrace Gentile
      believers in the first century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discover how the “fig tree”—the biblical symbol for the Jewish
      people—is blossoming, and how many are enjoying its fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Liberman was instrumental in founding and leading Messianic
      congregations in Washington, D.C., San Diego and in Israel. For
      five years, he served as the Executive Director of the
      International Messianic Jewish Alliance.
